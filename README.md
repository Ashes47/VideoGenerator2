# MoneyPrinter V2

An Application that automates the process of making money online.
MPV2 (MoneyPrinter Version 2) is, as the name suggests, the second version of the MoneyPrinter project. It is a complete rewrite of the original project, with a focus on a wider range of features and a more modular architecture.

> **Note:** MPV2 needs Python 3.9 to function effectively.

## Features

- [x] Twitter Bot (with CRON Jobs => `scheduler`)
- [x] YouTube Shorts Automater (with CRON Jobs => `scheduler`)
- [x] Affiliate Marketing (Amazon + Twitter)
- [x] Find local businesses & cold outreach

## Installation

Please install [Microsoft Visual C++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/visual-cpp-build-tools/) first, so that CoquiTTS can function correctly.

> ⚠️ If you are planning to reach out to scraped businesses per E-Mail, please first install the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FujiwaraChoki/MoneyPrinterV2.git

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment - Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate the virtual environment - Unix
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Documentation

All relevant document can be found [here](docs/).

## Scripts

For easier usage, there are some scripts in the `scripts` directory, that can be used to directly access the core functionality of MPV2, without the need of user interaction.

All scripts need to be run from the root directory of the project, e.g. `bash scripts/upload_video.sh`.
